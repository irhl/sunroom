sunroom is my emacs configuration, i have copied it here since it was too large to work on my dotfiles.
I'll be filling more of this README later, check back soon!

INSTALLATION
you can put the files in ~/.emacs.d
when first launching, you should wait for the whitescreen to disappear
behind the whitescreen thing is just emacs installing the packages and
finishing the startup process.

fl.el - mood room (themes)
fx.el - art class/workshop

fm.el - my dired tools
fo.el - my universal tools
fs.el - my global statusline
kb.el - my edit system (vim-like modal editing)
