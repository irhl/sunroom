sunroom is my emacs configuration, i have copied it here since it was too large to work on my dotfiles.
I'll be filling more of this README later, check back soon!

fl.el - mood room (themes)
fx.el - art class/workshop

fm.el - my dired tools
fo.el - my universal tools
fs.el - my global statusline
kb.el - my edit system (vim-like modal editing)

when installing my config, you can put it in ~/.emacs.d
when first launching, you should wait for the whitescreen to disappear
behind the whitescreen thing is just emacs installing the packages and
finishing the startup process.
