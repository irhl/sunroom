sunroom is my emacs configuration, i have copied it here since it was too large to work on my dotfiles.
I'll be filling more of this README later, check back soon!

INSTALLATION
you can put the files in ~/.emacs.d
then move the shell script to your bin directory.

use the shell script to execute emacs, so it does not do the startup
process everytime you launch emacs unless the process is not running.

in the first launch, you should wait for the whitescreen to disappear
behind the whitescreen thing is just emacs installing the packages and
finishing the startup process.

Maple Mono NF       for the cloud icon symbol
